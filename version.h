/*
 * version.h - Firmware version string

 * FW_VERSION is bumped manually on release. FW_GIT_HASH is injected at
 * build time by version.py (short git commit hash, "-dirty" if the
 * working tree has uncommitted changes). Falls back to "unknown" for
 * builds that skip the PlatformIO pre-build scripts (e.g. Arduino IDE).
